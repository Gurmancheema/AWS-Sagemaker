# AWS-Sagemaker
My first small application in AWS Sagemaker. I learned to create and use notebook instances and moreover the functionality of Sagemaker to build , train and deploy machine learning model. In this model I used XgBoost training algorithm which is present in Sagemaker itself and deployed the model.
